# BERT-Classification-PyTorch
School Project: Identify the sentences that include words related to software.
This is a project I'm working on for my NLP class at UTHealth. It's my first time applying a Pytorch classification model.
The data is in an XMI file with 3,259 sentences.I converted the XMI file to a CSV file in this notebook.
I achieved an F1 score of 0.94 and a recall of 0.90 in this approach.
